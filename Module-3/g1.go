//error handling
// error handling is defined as the management and resolution of errors or exceptions that can occur during the execution of a program. 

// go has a simple and strightforward scoping mechanism.

// Errors can take various forms, such as unexpected inputs, hardware failures, network issues, or logical mistakes in the code.

// Proper error handling is essential to ensure the robustness, reliability, and security of software systems.

// go encourages explicit error handling to make code more reliable and mainatanable

// Error Detection : Identifying situations or conditions that may result in errors

// Error Reporting: Communicating errors to relevant stakeholders, such as the user, admistrators, or other parts of the software systems.

// Error Handling: Implementing strategies to respond to errors when they occur.

// Error Recovery: In cases where an error can be managed or mitigated, error recovery mechanisms may be put in place to restore the systems to a consistent and operational state.
